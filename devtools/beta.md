The next version of ArConnect is right around the corner. We are almost ready with the final touches on the refactor, so we've made it available for power users and developers, so that they can prepare their applications in advance. The new version can be downloaded [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ekmpjilfjeghbjgddfgfbakkjmobfhhm).

## Installation

There are no extra steps to install the beta, you can download it from the [link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ekmpjilfjeghbjgddfgfbakkjmobfhhm).

## Migrating applications

Good news! The new version will support all the existing API functions, so there is **no need to migrate** or change anything in your application's logic.

Internally however, we changed up how the application data is stored, unifying permissions, allowances, etc. to make everything more understandable for the users.

## Major changes

- New design and branding
- Refactored, scalable and modular codebase that uses [Plasmo](https://plasmo.com) 
- Internalization (i18n)
- [Manifest V3](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/) support
- Improved DX (Developer Tooling)

The full changelog can be viewed [here](https://github.com/arconnectio/ArConnect/pull/95).
