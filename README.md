ArConnect is an Arweave-native wallet extension that provides secure wallet and asset management in your favorite browser. The extension allows Arweave wallet holders to interact with any dApps without sharing their private keys with them.

The secure environment that ArConnect creates is not only a security improvement for users, but it also provides a more seamless login flow for applications. Developers no longer have to build sign in functionality, they can let ArConnect do the hard work for them.
